	<h3>Long quote</h3>
	<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/7364010.Hikigaya_Hachiman"></blockquote>
	Everyone is a slave to their past. No matter how much you wish to move
	forward, the events of last year will bear down on you like the light of
	the stars as soon as you glance up. Unable to laugh or to banish your
	past, you carry it ceaselessly in a corner of your heart, waiting for it
	to resurrect at an inopportune moment.
	</blockquote>
	<h3>Short quote</h3>
	<q cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/7364010.Hikigaya_Hachiman">
		If to be truthful is to be cruel, then lying must surely be an act of kindness. And so, kindness is a lie.
