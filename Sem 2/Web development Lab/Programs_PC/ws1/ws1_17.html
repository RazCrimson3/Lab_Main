		<dt>Psions</dt>
		<dd>Psions (Thought Particles) are non-physical particles that come under the dimension of psychic phenomenon, an information element that records the result of cognizance and thought. They are similar to Pushions in that Pushions are the particle manifestations of emotions from intention and thought, while Psions are the particle manifestations of intention and thought. [Note: This is still at a hypothetical stage.]</dd>
		<dt>Pushions</dt>
		<dd>Pushions (Spirit Particles) are substance-less particles (non-physical entities) that come under the dimension of psychic phenomena. Their existence has been validated, however their true form or function has yet to be clarified. They are similar to Psions, in that Psions are particle manifestations of intention and thought, while Pushions are particle manifestations of the emotions from the intention and thought. [Note: This is still at a hypothetical stage.]</dd>
		<dt>Eidos</dt>
		<dd>Eidos refers to the event where the information of the target is temporarily overwritten. Information is associated with events. If the information is rewritten, the event will be rewritten. As the nature of phenomena is written in Psions, modifications to these will result in real world events being temporarily modified as well.</dd>
		<dt>Magic Calculation Area</dt>
		<dd>The Magic Calculation Area (魔法演算領域), or magic processor, is the part of the subconscious mind responsible for the use of magic. The Magic Calculation Area's transforms the imagined reality into data and produces a Magic Sequence for the desired spell. Generally speaking, target coordinates, strength and ending requirements are all set as variables to be executed by the Magic Calculation Area; all other essentials are incorporated into the Activation Sequence, which is then sent to the Magic Calculation Area and translated into a Magic Sequence.</dd>
		<dt>Flash Cast</dt>
		<dd>Flash Cast (フラッシュ・キャスト) is the Yotsuba Family's secret Single Systematic Magic Casting Techniques. It is made possible by mentally "carving" the images of the Activation Sequence into memory</dd>
